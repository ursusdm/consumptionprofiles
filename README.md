  <h3 align="center"Tool that allows generating clustering models to characterize household electricity consumption profiles. It includes an implementation of the k-ISAC algorithm, an algorithm for determining the optimal number of clusters by analyzing two curves with quality indicators of the clustering models (the MAE curve of the models, and the curve with the number of small clusters that has each model) </h3>

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the project

URSUS-CONSUMPTIONPROFILES is a script that implements a methodology to characterize the domestic electricity consumption profiles of any city using clustering algorithms and a new algorithm that allows determining the optimal number of clusters that best represents the consumption profiles.

...

### Technologies

* Python
* Pyspark
* Jupyter Notebook
* MLIB
  
 ### Datasets

 Any dataset where each row represents the hourly consumption (24 hours) of the day for any consumer. 
 The datasets that have been used for the publication of the article are private, so they cannot be uploaded to the repository.

  ### Script content
  
  The script implements the following functionalities:
  
  * Generation clustering models using big data k-means algorithm for kMin and kMax values for the number of clusters
  * Calculation the MAE of each model
  * Calculation the number of small cluster of each model
  * Determination of optimal k-value analyzing the MAE for each model curve, and the curve with the number of small clusters for each model. (k-ISAC algorithm) 

### Requirements

In order to run the script without problem, it is necessaryis necessary to have installed:

* Jupyter Notebook (Environment to run script cells). Script has comments on the main functionalities that each code cell implements.
* Python (main script language)
* Pyspark (spark with python)
* MLIB (machine Learning with Spark Library)


### Instalation


1. Clone repo
```sh
git clone  https://github.com/ursusdm/consumptionprofile.git
```
2. ** Open script with jupyter notebook and run cells **
